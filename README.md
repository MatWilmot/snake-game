# Snake Game

## Description

I followed along with a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34fnnxpjRAs) to build a simple game of Snake using canvas in HTML and JavaScript. There is some very basic CSS, too.

## Instructions

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake and collect the food.
- The game ends when you run into yourself or hit the edge of the play area.
- To reset the game, refresh the page.

## Future Development

I'd like to add more features to this game and tweak a couple of mechanics to be more in line with how I imagine a game of Snake should be.

- The game should get faster as your score goes up
- Add power-ups that affect score and snake speed
- Explore possibility of adding background music
- The game starts paused and waits for you to click a start button
- A reset button so you don't have to refresh the page to reset
- Fix a bug where if you press two directions in rapid succession, you're able to 'turn around' and run directly back into yourself
